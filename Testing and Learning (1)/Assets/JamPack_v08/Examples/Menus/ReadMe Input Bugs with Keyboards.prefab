  message: "Hacks to make the UI behave nicely with Keyboard / Joystick input. \n\nThere
    is quite a bit of UI hacking to make this work due to the poor support of keyboard
    buttons. You will often end up making your own UI Controller to manage UI state
    otherwise is can be tricky. I've fixed some of the common UI bugs you will encounter
    when trying to operate the Menu from a Button. \n\n1. Button is being pressed
    when i Open a menu with a button press. It is basically being clicked on the first
    frame. My solution was to edit the AdvancedTriggerListener2D to listen for the
    button released event and use that to open the menu. Sort of hacky though. \n\n2.
    The UI doesn't select the first button to be selected properly if you have more
    then one menu. I have added a small script SetSelectedButton to the Canvas_NPCDialogue
    GameObject that will select the first button to give selection state to and enable
    menu navigation. This is called in OnEnable and is useful if you are using multiple
    different menus that each need thier own button selected. \n\n3. If you click
    a mouse anywhere it breaks the UI selection. See the EventSystemHack script on
    the EventSystem for a fix. It basically just tracks the last selected UI element
    and reselects it if you lose focus of it (ie due to mouse click). \n\n4. Disable
    Mouse -  I also disable the mouse input and disable the Mouse cursor with the
    Disable Mouse script. If you want to use mouse input not keyboard most of this
    stuff is not needed.\n\nPress ESC to get out of the game view mode when the mouse
    is locked.\n\n5. I have this setup to use the OnSubmit event (there are many types
    of built in custom events to use) rather then the onClick, but you could easily
    use what I have in there on the onClick\n"
